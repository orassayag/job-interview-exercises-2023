# Node.js backend developer test for senior
Simple Rest API using Express - Live coding.

## Overview
Implement a basic RestApi app. You should create the required functions, routing and the folders structure.

## Details
* Implement these endpoints:

   /api/v1/postWithLongestTitle - all posts located in https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.
   
   /api/v1/userWithLongestName - all users located in https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users. 
   
* Any request should log to the console: Method: <request_type>, url: <url>.
 
* DELETE requests need to be blocked with forbidden status and response message "Delete is forbidden!".
  
  
## Additional considerations:
   * You cannot install new libraries.
   * Use "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com" api like is your database.
