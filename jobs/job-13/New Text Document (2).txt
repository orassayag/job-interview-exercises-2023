Coding question
# Context:
# A user is taking a covid questionnaire, and answers a series of Yes/No questions of wether or not they are experiencing a certain symptom. 
# Each symptom has an assigned severity.
# Some combinations of symptoms have an extra concerning combination severity assigned.

# Mission:
# Implement a method called `get_diagnosis`
# It will Sum the severity of all the symptoms that the user reported in the chat.
# If the total severity is higher than the threshold, return true. Otherwise, false.
# If 2 symptoms are marked as a concerning combination, add their extra interaction severity.

# ---

# Example
# *******

# IF:

#   Threshold: 6

#   Possible Symptoms:
#   Fever            -> severity: 3
#   Vomiting         -> severity: 2
#   Headache         -> severity: 1
#   Cough            -> severity: 1
#   Loss of Taste    -> severity: 2

#   Concerning Combinations:
#   Fever + Vomiting -> extra interaction severity: 1
#   Headache + Fever -> extra interaction severity: 3
#   Cough + Vomiting -> extra interaction severity: 1

# THEN (Example of user responses and the diagnosis):

#   User Response                       Calculation                 Diagnosis
#   -------------                       -----------                 ---------
#   Fever + Vomiting                  = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6   !>  6   --> False
#   Fever + Headache                  = 3 + 1 + 3 = 7    >  6   --> True
#   Headache + Cough + Loss of Taste  = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4   !>  6   --> False
